# usePopcorn

## Description

![Screenshot](./public/screenshot.png)

This is a practice React application that allows users to search for movies from a Movie API (www.omdbapi.com). The main goal of this project was to get a grasp of the useState() hook and the flow of data (props). The application also allows users to rate the movies they watched and save their favorite movies to local storage. This application is not deployed on the web. Please see the installation section below to run the application on your local machine.

```bash
npm run start
```
